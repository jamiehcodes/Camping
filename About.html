<p> I'm a mom of the two most precious kids in the world (age 6 and 10 months), 
    and we just discovered the joy of camping this summer (despite my fear of hungry bears)! I also have a rockstar husband,
    who happens to be a wonderful dad as well. He has yet to experience the joy of camping with us, but promises to join the next trip!
    My favorite types of camping places are ones with lots of green trees and water (rivers, waterfalls). 
    The most memorable parts of my trips so far, include: 
    <br> * seeing a family of five deer coming onto our campsite within 15 feet of us 
    (just grazing and doing their own thing, before carrying on), 
    <br> * feeling the cool, refreshing water on a hot day when playing in the river
    <br> * being able to enjoy and connect with my kids as well as with nature without the noise of city life
    <br> * looking up at the sky full of stars 
    (which reminds me of how little we are; our lives, problems, and stressors may feel so big in our day-to-day, 
    but we are really insignificant in the grand scheme of things, which is amazing and freeing at the same time), 
    <br> * making campfires, and enjoying campfire talks with irreplaceable company of loved ones, under the peaceful, 
    sparkly night sky.
    <br>
    <br>
    Nature is Amazing! And I hope to enjoy it as often as possible!
